Skeleton for an Add-on in Firefox on Android
============================================

This code supplies the basic bits and pieces needed to build a simple,
restartless add-on for Firefox on Android, which uses a new native widget UI.
Since Firefox on Android does not use XUL for the UI, building an add-on is a
little different.

Using the Skeleton
==================

Step 1: Edit the install.rdf
  * Please change the ALL CAPS areas with text specific to your add-on

Step 2: Add code to bootstrap.js
  * The current code adds some menus, doorhangers and context menus that don't
    do very much right now.

Step 3: Edit config_build.sh
  * If you add any additional files, make sure you add them to config_build.sh
    See build.sh for more details

Step 4: run ./build.sh
  * This creates the XPI
